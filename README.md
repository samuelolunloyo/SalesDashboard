# Power BI Time Series Project

### **Overview**
This is my first portfolio project, aimed at showcasing my proficiency in Power BI.

The project is inspired by a portfolio showcased by Mo Chen and his wife on YouTube. You can view [the original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLxW9ZSuuVI&t=975s). 

**Dataset:** [Plant_DTS.xls](https://github.com/mochen862/power-bi-portfolio-project/blob/main/Plant_DTS.xls)

### **Project Steps**

#### **1. Importing Data into Power BI**
- Downloaded the dataset from the provided link and used the *Get Data* option in Power BI to import the Excel Workbook.

#### **2. Data Transformation in Power Query**
- Loaded necessary tables for analysis: `Accounts`, `plant_FACTS`, and `plant_HIERARCHY`.
- Applied the following transformations:
  - **Renamed tables** for clarity and consistency:
    - `Accounts` to `dim_accounts`
    - `plant_HIERARCHY` to `dim_product`
    - `plant_FACTS` to `fact_sales`
  - **Removed duplicates** in `product_name_id` (primary key in `dim_product`) and `Account_id` (identifier in `dim_accounts`).
  - Cleaned `latitude` and `country_name` fields by removing unnecessary characters.

After transformations, the clean data was loaded into the Power BI workspace.

#### **3. Creating Virtual Tables**
1. **Date Table**  
   - Created using the following DAX expression:
     ```dax
     dim_Date = CALENDAR(DATE(2022, 1, 1), DATE(2024, 12, 31))
     ```
   - The Date Table, combined with Power BIâ€™s time intelligence, generated a date hierarchy with Year, Quarter, Month, and Day levels for easy time-based filtering.

2. **Flag Column in Date Table**  
   - Created a calculated column in `dim_date` to filter data to only the last 12 months. This DAX expression creates a Boolean flag:
     ```dax
     inpast = 
     VAR lastsalesdate = MAX(fact_Sales[Date_Time])
     VAR lastsalesdatePY = EDATE(lastsalesdate, -12)
     RETURN dim_Date[Date] <= lastsalesdatePY
     ```

3. **Slicer Table**  
   - Created a slicer table for switch values by using *Enter Data*. The table, `slc_Values`, contains a single column, `Values`, populated with `Sales`, `Gross Profit`, and `Quantity`.

#### **4. Building Measures**
- **Base Measures**  
   Created the base measures for Sales, Quantity, and Gross Profit:
   ```dax
   Sales = SUM(fact_Sales[Sales_USD])
   Quantity = SUM(fact_Sales[Quantity])
   COGS = SUM(fact_Sales[Cost_of_goods_sold])
   Gross_Profit = [Sales] - [COGS]
   - **Year-to-Date (YTD) and Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD) Measures**  
   Created YTD and PYTD measures for tracking growth:
   - **PYTD**:
     ```dax
     PYTD_Sales = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(dim_Date[Date]), dim_Date[inpast] = TRUE())
     ```
   - Repeated the same process for Gross Profit and Quantity using similar logic.

   - **YTD**:
     ```dax
     YTD_GrossProfit = TOTALYTD([Gross Profit], dim_Date[Date])
     ```
   - Similarly, created YTD measures for Sales and Quantity.

- **Switch Measures for Slicer Options**  
   Created switch measures for easy selection of YTD and PYTD metrics:
   - **PYTD Switch**:
     ```dax
     S_PYTD = 
     VAR selected_value = SELECTEDVALUE(slc_Values[Values])
     VAR result = SWITCH(selected_value, "Sales", [PYTD_Sales], "Quantity", [PYTD_Quantity], "Gross Profit", [PYTD_GrossProfit], BLANK())
     RETURN result
     ```
   - **YTD Switch**:
     ```dax
     S_YTD = 
     VAR selected_value = SELECTEDVALUE(slc_Values[Values])
     VAR result = SWITCH(selected_value, "Sales", [YTD_Sales], "Quantity", [YTD_Quantity], "Gross Profit", [YTD_GrossProfit], BLANK())
     RETURN result
     ```

- **Comparative Measure (PYTD vs YTD)**  
   Calculated the difference to analyze year-over-year changes:
   ```dax
   PYTD_vs_YTD = [S_YTD] - [S_PYTD]
